# We used the following guides as a basis to build the FreeRADIUS config for eduroam, then customized further:
#  https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/eduroam and https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/eduroam-logging
# All config values (IPs, shared secrets, etc.), are set at runtime by the entrypoint script based on env vars
# (see README and custom.env).
#
# We add sqlite, a read-centric, in-memory, "serverless" flatfile database, to the freeradius container image
# for use cases where there is no external secure LDAP identity store. Be sure to persist /db if you want to
# manually inspect/update the local user DB even when the container isn't running.

# See https://hub.docker.com/r/freeradius/freeradius-server/

# Add packages:
#  syslog-ng: for syslog forwarding if chosen at runtime via env vars (recommended); we'd use busybox's own
#   syslogd, but it doesn't support TCP.
